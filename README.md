# Crowtube

A quick and dirty Invidious frontend, because I didn't like the existing ones lmao.

Thrown together in an evening in React+TypeScript, just for practice. (Somewhat) responsive, too!

## Setup

uuhhhh

1. Pull & cd in
2. `npm install`
3. (Optional, but highly recommended) Set a default API base URL in `src/utils/api.ts`
4. `npm run build` 👏️
